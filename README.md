Some data and code for figures describing my experience with breast cancer

Twitter thread here: https://twitter.com/louisahsmith/status/1179429494664388609?s=20

Code combined from a number of scripts I wrote throughout this process... as such, it is in general uncommented and just thrown together all in one file. I did write a blog post on one of the figures here: https://www.louisahsmith.com/post/github-style-calendar-heatmap/ and on collecting some of the data here: https://www.louisahsmith.com/post/secrets-and-robots/.

Some of the data is in the script itself.

Honestly the figures folder just contains screenshots of the figures due to laziness in figuring out sizing, etc. :-)
