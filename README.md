Some data and code for figures describing my experience with breast cancer

Twitter thread here: https://twitter.com/louisahsmith/status/1179429494664388609?s=20

Slides from my RLadies talk are `slides.pptx`.

Some of the datasets are in the `data` folder, others are in the scripts themselves. Code is generally uncommented, sorry! I did write a blog post on one of the figures here: https://www.louisahsmith.com/post/github-style-calendar-heatmap/ and on collecting some of the data here: https://www.louisahsmith.com/post/secrets-and-robots/.

Honestly the figures folder just contains screenshots of the figures due to laziness in figuring out sizing, etc. :-)
